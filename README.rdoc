Have you seen exceptions like this before?

"ActionController::NotImplemented: Only requests are allowed."

This is usually the result of a Microsoft product sending an OPTIONS request to your app with a user_agent of "Microsoft Office Protocol Discovery". This middleware will stop those requests in their tracks, and keep them from hitting your rails stack.

TO USE with Rails 2.3:

  gem install CodeOfficer-rack-options-request

then in your environment.rb:

  config.gem "CodeOfficer-rack-options-request", :lib => 'rack/options/request'
  config.middleware.use 'Rack::Options::Request'

Until I learn TDD, you can test your local app with ...

  curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/

Should return your normal content.

While ...

  curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/

Should return a 200 status and "Microsoft Office Protocol Discovery".
